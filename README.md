# Equalizer Theremin
HackRU Bose Project

We're using a Leap motion controller to track your hand movement, which is used to control an instrument (like a traditional theremin). Your left hand moves up and down to control volume, and your right hand moves left and, as right to control pitch. We also added some modifications, so moving your right hand forwards and backwards controls timbre. We use the Bose Sound Touch as the second part of the instrument, as we stream our generated notes to the speaker over Bluetooth and added extra features from the API to the Theremin. We use the web API to dramatically change the volume and change the strength of the bass, adding to the effect of changing timbre.
